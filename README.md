The lesson will have 3 stages  

1. deploy the vRops OVA  
2. config vRops to do basic stuff with a vCenter and some VMs  
3. Go to an envionrment that has more things so you can see what else vRops can do  

Do 1 and 2 in Ariel's homelab, which is a vRops "virgin"  
Move to Thom's homelab for 3  

For it to be "from zero to useful" **we must**:  

- Start with just the OVA and show how it's deployed  
- Have an appliance already deployed so we don't lose time  
- Log into the appliance for the first time, has to be totally unconfigured
